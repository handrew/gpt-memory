# ðŸ§  MemoryAgent

LocalFilesystemMemory is a layer over Llama Index's GPTSimpleVectorIndex which
abstracts away the details of managing indexes saved on disk. It assumes /
creates a directory structure for storing indexes and provides a simple /
interface for managing them.

The directory structure is as follows:
```
- index_folder/
    -  metadata.json
    -  indexes/
        -  index_1.json
        -  index_2.json
        -  ...
```

The metadata.json file contains the following information:

```
{
    "index_count": 2,
    "index_descriptions": [
        {
            "name": "index_1",
            "description": "Description of index generated by GPT Index.",
        },
        {
            "name": "index_2",
            "description": "Description of index generated by GPT Index.",
        },
    ]
}
```

An example:

```python
from llama_index import SimpleDirectoryReader
from gpt_memory import LocalMemoryAgent
phil = SimpleDirectoryReader("gpt_memory/examples/phil")
animals = SimpleDirectoryReader("gpt_memory/examples/animals")
phil_docs = phil.load_data()
animal_docs = animals.load_data()

memory = LocalMemoryAgent("example")
# memory.create_index("phil", phil_docs)
# memory.create_index("animals", animal_docs)
query = "What is a capybara?"
print(memory.query(query))
```

Returns: ```A capybara is a giant cavy rodent native to South America, which is the largest living rodent and a member of the genus Hydrochoerus. It inhabits savannas and dense forests, lives near bodies of water, and is a highly social species that can be found in groups as large as 100 individuals. The capybara is hunted for its meat and hide and also for grease from its thick fatty skin, but it is not considered a threatened species.```
